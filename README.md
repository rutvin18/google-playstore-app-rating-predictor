# google-playstore-app-rating-predictor
ML project to predict Google Play Store app ratings using feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

# Google Play Store App Rating Predictor

## Description
Machine learning project that predicts **Google Play Store app ratings** based on app metadata (e.g., category, reviews, size, installs). Focus is on clean preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## What I did
- Data cleaning (missing values, inconsistent formats like installs/size)
- Feature engineering (encoding categories, transforming numeric fields)
- Trained baseline + improved models and evaluated performance
- Documented insights and key drivers affecting ratings

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in `notebooks/` (or run scripts in `src/`)
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
